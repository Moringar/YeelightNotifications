I needed a clear indicator to know when i'm mute on voice channels, so i did this.<br>
No discord bot is required : a controller and a lightbulb is enough. <br>


### SETUP

Provide the local ip addresses of your bulbs:
```sh
bulbRight = Bulb("192.168.1.155")
bulbLeft = Bulb("192.168.1.61")
```
Select you HID device
```sh
controller.open(0x1b4f, 0x9206)
```

select the button to use to trigger notifications
```sh
if inputReport[3] == 8:
```


üõ†Ô∏è This script can be easily modified to suit more bulbs and more notifications types.<br>
Ideas :
- Trigger for windows notifications
- connection to a discord bot

#### üü¢ This script is light an use minimal ressources from CPU / RAM.

## Installation
#### manual start:
double click the script. üëå

#### Auto start:

It's working üëç
